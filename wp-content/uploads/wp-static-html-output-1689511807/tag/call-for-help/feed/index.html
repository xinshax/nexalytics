<p>One significant aspect concerning individuals from India is the lack of adequate sex education provided to them. In this blog, I aim to discuss an incident that occurred during my classmate&#8217;s school days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">the junior girl.</h2>



<p>My friend, he was a 10th-grade student who had qualified for the district-level Art festival after succeeding at the school level. Approximately 30-40 students from our school were participating, including him. The day before the event, a friendly girl approached him and established a positive connection.</p>



<p>On the event day of his junior year, he boarded the school-arranged bus and found a seat. However, the junior girl arrived late and discovered that all the seats were occupied. Despite having her classmates and friends on the bus, she chose to sit on my friend&#8217;s lap. He didn&#8217;t mind and considered her as a younger sister or a friend. However, he began to feel uncomfortable as he noticed her hand sliding over him. Despite this discomfort, he didn&#8217;t say anything, assuming it was accidental or casual.</p>



<p>Upon reaching the venue, everyone proceeded to their assigned classroom, but my friend realized he had forgotten his power bank on the bus. Unaware that the girl had followed him, he returned to the bus in the parking lot, searching for his power bank. He got into the bus and was searching for the power bank and this junior girl pushed him to the seat, sat on his lap and kissed him! FORCEFULLY.</p>



<p>&nbsp;He was traumatized and blanked out. He was helpless and he was numb. He was innocent. He was just 14.</p>



<p>She used him for her pleasure without his consent. She never spoke to him after that. He was in 10th, a 14 years old boy who got sexual assaulted by a 13 years old in his school. Assaulted by a junior girl!</p>



<p> He started questioning himself, he lost himself, he started blaming himself for not reacting it or for whatever happened. He carried that trauma for the whole year.</p>



<p>He wasn&#8217;t the same after that. He was scared to socialize with girls. He was scared of everyone. He was helpless. He didn&#8217;t tell this to anyone. He didn&#8217;t even see this coming. He felt him being used by this world. </p>



<p>The girl was happy and living her life with her pleasures and happiness and this boy was exhausted because she used him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where is the justice? Where are his rights? Even if he would have said this to the boys in his class who are also not mature, they would have made fun of him saying he got used by a junior girl. Nobody was there for him. He was traumatized for something he didn&#8217;t even do. </p>



<p>THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TOUCH SOMEONE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT!</p>
