<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction :</h2>



<p>Jio is an Indian telecommunications company that was introduced in 2016 and has since revolutionized the Indian telecom market. The company is owned by Reliance Industries Limited, one of India&#8217;s largest conglomerates. With its focus on providing 4G LTE services, smartphones, and a range of digital services, Jio quickly gained a significant market share in India&#8217;s highly competitive telecom market. Its innovative pricing strategy and investment in infrastructure, such as fiber optic cables, helped to differentiate it from its competitors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Jio and 4G bands!</h2>



<p>In addition to Jio&#8217;s innovative pricing strategy, investment in infrastructure, and focus on digital services, there was another key factor that allowed them to take over the Indian cellular network business with 4G technology.</p>



<p>While other telecom companies were trying to provide 3G networks throughout the country, Mr. Mukesh Ambani, the owner of Jio, had a different vision. He decided to purchase 4G bands by representing the low-profiled brand Aircel, which enabled him to acquire 4G spectrum licenses at a fraction of the cost compared to his competitors.</p>



<p>This strategic move allowed Jio to have a head start in providing 4G services to the Indian market while other players were still struggling to provide 3G services. As a result, Jio was able to build a loyal customer base quickly, and their affordable data plans and high-speed connectivity became a game-changer in the industry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Jio&#8217;s Product Presentation and Pricing.</h2>



<p>Jio introduced the concept of unlimited calls and data per day to the Indian network market, which was a game-changer. Prior to Jio&#8217;s entry, most telecom companies were selling data packets, and customers had to pay for voice calls separately. Jio&#8217;s unlimited call and data plan disrupted the market, and other players had to follow suit to remain competitive.</p>



<p>Jio&#8217;s pricing strategy for these plans was highly attractive to the Indian customer base, who were price-sensitive and were looking for value for their money. This pricing strategy led to a significant increase in data consumption in India, and the number of people using mobile data surged.</p>



<p>The surge in data consumption led to a massive investment in data networks and infrastructure, resulting in an increase in internet penetration across India. This shift in customer behavior led to a rise in digital services and e-commerce, which further benefited Jio&#8217;s business model.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion.</h2>



<p>Jio&#8217;s successful takeover of the Indian cellular network market with its 4G technology and innovative pricing strategy, which introduced unlimited calls and data per day, has had far-reaching implications for the Indian telecommunications industry. Jio&#8217;s early adoption of 4G technology and strategic acquisition of 4G spectrum licenses enabled it to quickly build a loyal customer base, while its investment in infrastructure, such as fiber optic cables, and focus on digital services helped it to differentiate itself from its competitors. This led to a significant increase in data consumption, resulting in a rise in digital services and e-commerce. Furthermore, Jio&#8217;s success demonstrates the importance of offering value to price-sensitive customers and investing in infrastructure to enable the growth of digital services. Overall, Jio&#8217;s disruptive entry into the Indian telecom market has fundamentally transformed the industry and set the stage for continued innovation and growth in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In India, Patanjali is a well-known company with two sides to it. On one hand, it&#8217;s a highly successful business that has built its fortune by leveraging India&#8217;s cultural roots. On the other hand, the company has a dark side that has led to constant scrutiny over substandard products and violations of industry regulations. But let&#8217;s focus on the positive aspects first. Patanjali has become a 10,000 crore company with a unique company culture that&#8217;s based on the guru bhai system. When the company&#8217;s founder, Ramdev, walks in, all employees touch his feet as a sign of respect. But this is not just reserved for Ramdev; the CEO and other senior staff are also included. Meetings are held on floors instead of round tables to emphasize equality and a disciple-like relationship among employees. Despite its controversies, Patanjali is often seen as a genuinely Indian company, fighting against multinational corporations for a piece of the market. This has allowed them to build strong supplier relationships and high margins, which ultimately results in lower prices for consumers with smaller budgets.</p>



<p>A significant portion of Patanjali&#8217;s products are outsourced because their scale of manufacturing makes it impossible to do it all in-house. However, they have excellent suppliers, and since many employees at Patanjali work as a form of service, their profit margins are high, which enables them to offer products at a lower price than the competition. This is particularly beneficial to consumers as research has shown that Indian consumers have limited financial resources, and they may opt for the lower-priced Patanjali salt over Tata salt, which is more expensive.</p>



<p>Let me tell you a bit about Ramdev. He comes from a humble background, his father was an illiterate farmer, and Ramdev attended a government school. Later, he studied at Arsh Gurukul Mahavidyalaya, and it was at Kalwa Gurukul where he met his co-founder, Balakrishna. While Balakrishna appears to be the business mind behind Patanjali, owning 94% of the company, Ramdev owns none of it. Patanjali tapped into the sense of patriotism and loyalty that many Indians feel, especially those over 40 years old, by offering products that had Indian roots but could compete on the same scale as multinational corporations. They focused on the highest targeted market in India, and it paid off with products like Dant Kanti, a 1000 crore brand, Herbal soap, which sells 500 crores worth of soap per year, and Atta, which generates 400 crores in sales annually, among others. Despite being separate products, their house of brand strategy, led by their first Ayurveda chain, seems to be a winning strategy in India.</p>



<p>When Patanjali first started selling products, it used a distribution network that included super distributors, regular distributors, and franchise dispensaries known as Chikitsalayas. These dispensaries function like a doctor-patient relationship, where specialists offer free patient consultations and then recommend ayurvedic medicines accordingly. In addition to Chikitsalayas, Patanjali has Arogya Kendras, which are wellness centers, and Swadeshi Kendras, which are non-drug centers.</p>



<p>Many people believe that Patanjali does not advertise, but the truth is that they do. They understand their target audience and which media they consume. For example, they advertise on TV channels like Star TV and Zee, which are popular with the older generation. Patanjali spends around two percent of their revenue on advertising. However, there is a downside to Patanjali that needs to be addressed.</p>



<p>In our experience studying different companies, we haven&#8217;t come across any other company that has been involved in as many fraudulent cases as Patanjali. We&#8217;re not trying to attack Ramdev or Patanjali, but we&#8217;re simply sharing what we found during our research. Patanjali is able to keep their prices low by accepting low profit margins and by treating their employees&#8217; work as a form of spiritual service.</p>



<p>Ramdev believes that working for Patanjali is not just a job, but a divine service that benefits the nation and preserves India&#8217;s heritage of yoga and Ayurveda. However, if employees ask for a raise, they risk being perceived as selfish and unpatriotic because this is the narrative that exists within the company. We have spoken to insiders to verify these claims. Ramdev exploits the public&#8217;s deep-rooted fear of multinational corporations colonizing India to reinforce this narrative. While the cause may be noble, this approach has led to some negative consequences for Patanjali employees.</p>



<p>Patanjali pays its workers 6,000 rupees per month for working long shifts, 6 days a week, and they justify it as a patriotic act. You might have heard people, even your own family members, advocating for Patanjali products because they are marketed as fresh, natural, and thoroughly tested. Some of the most devoted fans even believe that all the products are made in one location under the direct guidance of Baba Ramdev and Acharya Bal Krishna.</p>



<p>When you consider the scale of Patanjali, which has a revenue of 10,000 crores, it&#8217;s practically impossible for them to manufacture all their products in-house. This raises concerns about their claims of purity, ingredients, and quality control. For instance, the Ministry of Defence Canteen Stores Department (CSD) suspended Patanjali&#8217;s amla juice after receiving a negative report from state and central labs.</p>



<p>Patanjali, a company with a revenue of 10,000 crores, claims to manufacture products with pure and high-quality ingredients. However, it is practically impossible for a company of this size to manufacture everything in-house without relying on third-party manufacturers. This raises doubts about the claims of purity and quality assurance made by Patanjali. The company has been involved in several incidents where its products were found to be substandard or mislabelled. Acharya Balakrishna, who owns 94% of the company, has no experience or knowledge in Ayurvedic medicine. Furthermore, Ramdev, the face of the company, has had 100 cases filed against him by the Uttarakhand government for various offenses. The company has also been accused of misleading advertising and poor testing practices. Despite their massive revenue, it&#8217;s unclear whether Patanjali is an ideal company that others should follow. In fact, between April 2005 and July 2016, the Advertising Standards Council of India received 33 complaints against 21 of their ads, with 17 of them violating asci standards.</p>



<p>In September 2017, the Delhi High Court ordered Patanjali to stop airing an advertisement for its chyawanprash brand that attacked a competitor on live TV. However, this is not the only instance where Patanjali has acted against science, law, morality, and common sense. While natural products can have many benefits, they can also be harmful, and Patanjali&#8217;s claims need to be taken with caution.</p>



<p>One example is the drug Andrographis, which Patanjali promotes as an immune booster. However, it can be a potent immune suppressant, and dose control is necessary. Baba Ramdev also makes claims that &#8220;Kapal Bhati&#8221; can cure all diseases, but cardiologists warn against it as it can worsen heart disease and high blood pressure.</p>



<p>Despite Patanjali&#8217;s claims of using only natural and herbal ingredients, there were allegations in the company&#8217;s early days that it used animal contents in its products. While these allegations were never substantiated, they do raise concerns about the company&#8217;s claims.</p>



<p>Over the last 20-30 years, Ramdev has become an expert at controlling the narrative. This was evident when covid-19 emerged in 2019, and Patanjali saw it as an opportunity to increase business by announcing a drug named Coronil, marketed as a cure for covid-19 patients. Unfortunately, the drug received negative publicity, and the company faced criminal complaints for misleading the public and endangering lives. The Madras High Court imposed a fine of 10 lakhs on the company for exploiting people&#8217;s fears and anxieties.</p>



<p>In February 2021, Patanjali claimed that Coronil had been approved by the Ministry of Ayush and certified by the World Health Organization. However, fact-checking outlets like The Wire, BBC News, and The Economic Times debunked this claim, as there was no evidence to support it. Reports suggested that Ramdev had released studies showing that Coronil was effective against covid-19, but the WHO stated that it had not approved any traditional medicine for treating the virus.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important for Patanjali to prioritize the quality of their products, even if it means increasing prices by a small amount. While we support the company&#8217;s commitment to promoting Indian heritage and hope that they can serve as an example for others to follow, we also hope that they can avoid being associated with fraud and scams. It&#8217;s crucial that Patanjali takes steps to improve their practices and regain public confidence.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">why urban monkey?</h2>



<p>The brand&#8217;s founder Ankit Agarwal had a 1000IQ marketing strategy which he made in the year 2020 which is something worth discussing. Urban Monkey appeared on the Indian version of the popular TV show &#8220;Shark Tank&#8221; in 2020, which helped the brand gain significant exposure and reach a wider audience.</p>

They are currently leading this genre of streetwear style with their proper implications of marketing strategy and trying new ways to market and stand out from other brand&#8217;s usual marketing schemes.</p>
